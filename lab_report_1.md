# Lab Report 1

## Hello fellow CSE 15L students! This is a tutorial on how to setup and ssh(login) into your course specific CSE 15L account, install and setup VSCode in your local environment.
## NOTE: This tutorial is created specifically for students who poses a version of the mac operating system(OS). Although many of the steps are similar to what you would do in a Windows OS, some steps might differ.

Outline:
 1. Explain how to install and setup VSCode on both environments(label where you can possibly get stuck on).
 2. Remotely connecting to ieng6
 3. Trying some commands in ieng6 and exlainning what a remote server is and how this connection is possible.

Add some resources in every step so that the reader can better understand what's going on(Youtube videos, docs, etc.). Try to make this tutorial as if you were explaining this to a **COMPLETE BEGINNER**. Check spelling and grammar at the end.

**Steps:**
	1. Installing VSCode:
		First you might ask what is VSCode? That's a great question! VSCode is an Integrated Development Environment(IDE). What is an IDE? In simple terms, an IDE is a special software tool that helps you write and create computer programs. It's like a digital workshop where you can build and shape your ideas into working software. Think of an IDE as a bundle of useful tools that make your programming tasks easier. It's designed to help you write code, test it, and fix any mistakes or bugs you encounter along the way. With an IDE, you don't have to juggle multiple programs or manually set up everything yourself. It provides a convenient and organized workspace for your coding projects. This are the key components you'll find in an IDE:
		* Code editor: The code editor is like a digital notebook where you write your program's instructions. It has features like color-coding (syntax highlighting) to make your code easier to read, and it helps you spot mistakes in real-time. The editor also offers suggestions as you type, saving you time and effort.
		* Compiler or Interpreter: These are the tools that take your written code and turn it into something the computer can understand and execute. A compiler converts your entire program into an executable file, while an interpreter processes and runs the code line by line.
		* Debugger: Finding and fixing bugs can be challenging, but the debugger is there to help. It lets you pause your program at specific points to see what's happening step by step. You can examine the values of variables and identify where things might be going wrong, making it easier to correct errors.
		* Build Tools: As your programs become more complex, you'll need additional tools to manage them. Build tools help you compile your code, package it together, and handle any dependencies (extra pieces of code your program relies on). They make sure your program is ready to run correctly.
		* Version Control: Version control tools help you manage different versions of your code. They allow you to save snapshots of your project at various stages, track changes, and collaborate with others without overwriting each other's work. It helps you keep your code organized and enables teamwork.
		To install VSCode:
			1. Open up your favorite internet browser(Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
			2. In the search bar type the following link: [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
