# Lab Report 1

## Hello fellow CSE 15L students! This is a tutorial on how to setup and ssh(login) into your course specific CSE 15L account in the remote ieng6 server, running a few commands in the remote server, install and setup VSCode in your local environment.
## NOTE: This tutorial is created specifically for students who poses a version of the mac operating system(OS). Although many of the steps are similar to what you would do in a Windows OS, some steps might differ.

Outline:
 1. Explain how to install and setup VSCode on both environments(label where you can possibly get stuck on).
 2. Remotely connecting to ieng6
 3. Trying some commands in ieng6 and explaining what a remote server is and how this connection is possible.

Add some resources in every step so that the reader can better understand what's going on(Youtube videos, docs, etc.). Try to make this tutorial as if you were explaining this to a **COMPLETE BEGINNER**. Check spelling and grammar at the end.

**Steps:**
1. Installing VSCode:

  First you might ask what is VSCode? That's a great question! VSCode is an Integrated Development Environment(IDE). What is an IDE? In simple terms, an IDE is a special software tool that helps you write and create computer programs. It's like a digital workshop where you can build and shape your ideas into working software. Think of an IDE as a bundle of useful tools that make your programming tasks easier. It's designed to help you write code, test it, and fix any mistakes or bugs you encounter along the way. With an IDE, you don't have to juggle multiple programs or manually set up everything yourself. It provides a convenient and organized workspace for your coding projects. This are the key components you'll find in an IDE:
	* Code editor: The code editor is like a digital notebook where you write your program's instructions. It has features like color-coding (syntax highlighting) to make your code easier to read, and it helps you spot mistakes in real-time. The editor also offers suggestions as you type, saving you time and effort.
	* Compiler or Interpreter: These are the tools that take your written code and turn it into something the computer can understand and execute. A compiler converts your entire program into an executable file, while an interpreter processes and runs the code line by line.
	* Debugger: Finding and fixing bugs can be challenging, but the debugger is there to help. It lets you pause your program at specific points to see what's happening step by step. You can examine the values of variables and identify where things might be going wrong, making it easier to correct errors.
	* Build Tools: As your programs become more complex, you'll need additional tools to manage them. Build tools help you compile your code, package it together, and handle any dependencies (extra pieces of code your program relies on). They make sure your program is ready to run correctly.
	* Version Control: Version control tools help you manage different versions of your code. They allow you to save snapshots of your project at various stages, track changes, and collaborate with others without overwriting each other's work. It helps you keep your code organized and enables teamwork.

  To install VSCode:
	1. Open up your favorite internet browser(Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
	2. In the search bar type the following link: [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). You will be redirected to a page like the one shown below: **ADD IMAGE OF THIS STEP!!!!!**.

  3. To choose the correct version of VSCode to download you need to exactly which version of the macOS you're running as well as some hardware specs of your laptop. To do this go to your Mac's menu bar and click the apple logo and select the first option labeled: **About This Mac**. This will open of an overview of your laptop's specifications(see the image below) like the version of macOS as well as processor. If you're laptop is running a macOS version 10.11+ than select the version of VSCode that is under the Apple logo labeled **macOS 10.11+**. If it's running a previous version you will have to download the .zip files based on the processor that you're laptop has. If within the processor section of your laptop's specs states that is using Intel, then select the .zip file labeled **Intel chip**. If you have one of the latest mac laptops you might have an M1 or M2 processor. If that's the case choose the .zip file labeled **Apple silicon**.
  4. After selecting the option in the previous step you will be redirected to a download page(see the image below) and VSCode will automatically start downloading. If VSCode does not automatically start downloading within a minute, click on the link in the page labeled **direct download link**.
  5. After VSCode finished downloading, open Finder and select the Downloads section. To spot the VSCode download quickly you can right click on Finder and click on the option **Sort By > Date Created**. Depending on VSCode version you downloaded the .zip file in your downloads will be generically be labeled **VSCode-some_text.zip**. Double click that .zip file.
  6. Next you will see the VSCode application being created in your Downloads folder(see the image below). You need to move VSCode from your Downloads directory to your Applications directory. To do that you can just easily drag the the VSCode icon within the Downloads directory and drop it in the Applications directory within the Finder window.
  7. Next, the macOS will ask you for your user password to be able to move VSCode to the Applications directory. Type is and press Enter.
  **Success** :thumbsup: You have successfully installed VSCode to your local environment. Fell free to open and play around the IDE.
2. Remotely connecting to the ieng6 server
    This is a fun step because it
